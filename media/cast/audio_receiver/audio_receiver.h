// AudioReceiver receives packets out-of-order while clients make requests for
// complete frames in-order.  (A frame consists of one or more packets.)
//
// AudioReceiver also includes logic for computing the playout time for each
// frame, accounting for a constant targeted playout delay.  The purpose of the
// playout delay is to provide a fixed window of time between the capture event
// on the sender and the playout on the receiver.  This is important because
// each step of the pipeline (i.e., encode frame, then transmit/retransmit from
// the sender, then receive and re-order packets on the receiver, then decode
// frame) can vary in duration and is typically very hard to predict.
//
// Two types of frames can be requested: 1) A frame of decoded audio data; or 2)
// a frame of still-encoded audio data, to be passed into an external audio
// decoder.  Each request for a frame includes a callback which AudioReceiver
// guarantees will be called at some point in the future unless the
// AudioReceiver is destroyed.  Clients should generally limit the number of
// outstanding requests (perhaps to just one or two).
//
// This class is not thread safe.  Should only be called from the Main cast
// thread.
